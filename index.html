  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 15 October 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Hunger Valley ("we", "us", or "our") collects, stores, uses and shares your information when you use our food delivery app.
  </p>
  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We collect basic personal information such as your name and mobile number when you register or place an order in the app.
  </p>
  <h2>How Your Information is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To register and authenticate your account.</li>
    <li>To process your food delivery requests and show order history.</li>
    <li>To send notifications about your order status and app updates (using Firebase Cloud Messaging).</li>
    <li>To improve our app and customer service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Firebase</h2>
  <p>
    We use Google Firebase for real-time database management and sending notifications. Your basic information (name and number) is stored securely on Firebase servers. We do not store sensitive information like payment details, as the app does not process payments.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>With our delivery partners, only as needed to deliver your orders.</li>
    <li>With service providers (like Firebase) as required for hosting and notifications.</li>
    <li>When required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use commercially reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our service is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention & Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Your information is retained as long as your account is active. You can request account deletion any timeâ€”see <a href="https://dukedineshbhatt.github.io/privacy-policy/account-deletion.html">Account Deletion</a> for more.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy as our services evolve. Any changes will be posted on this page.
